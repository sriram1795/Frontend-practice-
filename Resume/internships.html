            <b><u><mark>1 . Human Activity Recognition Web App Using Google Gemini AI:</mark> </u></b><br><br>
            <span>
                <b><u>Objective</u></b>     : To develop a web application that detects and describes human actions from uploaded images 
                                            and videos using Googleâ€™s AI-powered vision-language model. <br><br>

                <b><u>Data Processing</u></b>    : Used OpenCV to extract key frames from video uploads. <br>
                                                Converted frames to image format for AI-based analysis. <br>
                                                uploads and session data using Django. <br><br>

                <b><u>Model Used</u></b>     : Integrated Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (GenerativeModel API) to analyze images and generate 
                                                text-based descriptions of human activities. <br>
                                                Used frame-wise inference to interpret actions and summarize video content. <br><br>

                <b><u>Key Features</u></b>     : Built with Python and Django for full-stack development. <br>
                                                Enabled image and video upload, real-time activity recognition, and result display. <br>
                                                Stored user activity results in the database using Django models. <br>
                                                Developed a clean user interface for login, upload, and viewing prediction summaries. <br><br>

            </span><br><br>
            <strong><b><u><mark>2 . Stress Prediction Project Overview:</mark> </u></b><br><br></strong>
            <span>
                <b><u>Objective</u></b>     : The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict stress levels 
                                            from textual data. The project involves analyzing user inputs and categorizing them 
                                            as either stressful or non-stressful based on sentiment. <br><br>

                <b><u>Data Processing</u></b>    : The data is preprocessed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, 
                                                including tokenization, stop word removal, and vectorization. <br> 
                                                The CountVectorizer is used to transform text into a numerical format suitable for 
                                                machine learning models. <br><br>

                <b><u>Model Used</u></b>     : A machine learning model, likely a logistic regression classifier, was trained using the processed data. <br>
                                              The model was evaluated on test data, with an accuracy of 75.18%. <br><br>

                <b><u>Key Features</u></b>     : Preprocessing of text data using NLP techniques. <br>
                                             Model prediction using machine learning to classify text as indicating stress or not. <br>
                                             Simple user input interface to predict stress from custom text entries. <br><br>

            <b><u><strong><mark>3. Music Genre Prediction Project: </mark></u></b><br><br></strong>
            <span>
                <b><u>Objective</u></b>     : The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts a person's favorite music genre based on their age and gender. <br><br>

                <b><u>Data Processing</u></b>    : The dataset contains three features: age, gender, and genre. The age and gender columns serve as input features, while genre is the target label. <br>
                                                    The data is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from Scikit-learn. <br><br>

                <b><u>Model Used</u></b>     : A Decision Tree Classifier is used for predicting the music genre. <br>
                                            The model is trained on the training data (x_train, y_train) and then tested on unseen data (x_test, y_test) <br><br>

                <b><u>Key Features</u></b>     : Use of a decision tree model to classify music genres based on user demographics.  <br>
                                                Implementation of train_test_split for model evaluation. <br>
                                                Calculation of accuracy using the accuracy_score metric <br><br>
